# OnePieceAPI Documentation:


•	Why are we doing this? 
“We are doing this project to create one-piece characters with all their characteristic and data”

•	How I expected the challenge to go. 
“I had excepted each challenge to be difficult until I followed a scheme of altering controller, service, integration test which held everything to together when I focused on individual features”

•	What went well? / What didn't go as planned? 
“Some of the nested queries couldn’t work, I didn’t have differentiation between a column contents that was scalable enough to separate into groups of data.”

•	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 
“I would attach a cloud database that could store 100s of  prepopulated data so that there would be differentiation of data and also the API would be handier and more fun to use.”
